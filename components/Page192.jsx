            third-party service providers) in countries other than the country
            in which the information originally was collected, including the UK.
            Those countries may not have the same data protection laws as the
            country in which you initially provided the information. When we
            transfer your information to recipients in these countries, we will
            protect that information as described in this Privacy Policy and
            will comply with applicable legal requirements to provide adequate
            protection for the transfer of personal information to recipients in
            countries other than the one in which you provided the information.

            providing adequate protection for the transfer of personal
            information to recipients in countries outside of the EEA and
            Switzerland. Your information will also be transferred to our third
            party service providers in the U.S. We have implemented appropriate
            safeguards designed to ensure an adequate level of data protection,
            including by concluding data transfer agreements incorporating the
            European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses under Article 46
            of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), or by selecting
            UK and U.S. service providers that are certified to the Privacy
            Shield frameworks.
